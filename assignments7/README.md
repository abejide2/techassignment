## CICD, Infrastructure as as Code (IaC), Terraform, Packer and Ansible

1. Your provisioning architecture has been partitioned into two tiers - a base network infrastructure tier and an application tier - each of which is provisioined using Terraform and has its own state file. Describe how you could dynamically retrieve parameters that are held in the base network tier state file from within the application tier Terraform definitions.





## System Architecture and Application Design, Cloud Computing (AWS)

1. In terms of network connection between a client and a server, describe the following;
https://tldp.org/HOWTO/TCP-Keepalive-HOWTO/overview.html
https://www.keyfactor.com/blog/what-is-tls-handshake-how-does-it-work/

* Connection sessions
* TCP handshake
* TLS handshake
* TCP Keepalive

2. Your technical requirement calls for a full end-2-end encryption of traffic between the client and backend servers through an AWS Application Load Balancer. Describe how you would set up this configuration.

3. How does the AWS Application Load Balancer determine which are the healthy backend servers to route traffic to? (Check this docuement https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/target-group-health-checks.html)

4. The main configurable components of the AWS Application Load Balancers are given below. Describe each of these and how they are related to one another.
* Listeners
* Target groups
* Targets
* Elastic Load Balancer nodes
* Health Checks


5. Research these infrastructure components and why you might use each in your solutions architecture;
* A Proxy Load Balancer
* A PassThru Load Balancer
* A reverse proxy

6. Why might you want to use a TLS certificate in a solution architecture?
